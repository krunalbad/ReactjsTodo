For more exposure in React.js, I have created a simple Todo app using browser storage. Free to use for anyone. Build deployed on Heroku.

There is no API or something like that.
All safe and secure in your browser.

[Visit this live running React App. It's not a build. It's a dev project.](https://reactkrunal.herokuapp.com/todos)
